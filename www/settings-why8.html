      In Hebrew, the number eight means, ‘new beginning’ and in God, each day is a new beginning.  It’s another opportunity to grow in your relationship with God and to fulfill the plan and purpose He created for you from the beginning of time (Ephesians 2:10). </p>
      <p> Also, the logo of Awakening to God Ministries is an eight on its side which means infinity.  You will make wise decisions if you live your life knowing that your life in this age is only, ‘a cover page of a never ending story!’[1]  God is preparing you for this life and the life to come.</p>
        <p>
        The founders of ‘Awakening to God Ministries’[2] have experienced unbelievable suffering in the passing of two of their three children.Their children both passed on to heaven on the eighth of the month and eight years apart!
