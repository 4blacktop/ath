		  <div class="content-block">
			<p>You were created for a relationship with God and, through Jesus Christ, you have fullness of life in Him. Jesus said, “My sheep hear my voice” and as you hear His voice you will come alive!  This App will help you to grow in your relationship with God.  
			</p>
			<p>Be intentional to prioritize eight minutes every morning to come aside and be quiet in God’s presence. Resist the temptation to be distracted by other things and turn off the ‘noise’ e.g. social media. After all, you’re meeting with the King of Kings!  </p>
			<p>If you follow the simple guidelines you will learn to hear God’s voice. These are only suggestions and you can adjust them day by day</p>

      <div class="swiper-slide"><span>Minute 1</span>
		  <div class="content-block">
			Still your mind and focus on one or two things you want to thank God for today. In the quietness, meditate on why you are grateful for the things you’ve chosen.

		<div class="swiper-slide"><span>Minute 2</span>
		  <div class="content-block">
			Memorize and meditate on the day’s verse from the Bible – speak it out loud.

		<div class="swiper-slide"><span>Minute 3 and 4</span>
		  <div class="content-block">
			As a sign of humility and surrender, you may want to lift up your hands and, looking up, ask God to fill you with His Holy Spirit (to fill every area of your life). In the quietness, ask God to speak to you. Listen for God’s voice in the thoughts and impressions that come into your mind.
		  </div>
	  </div>
	  
		<div class="swiper-slide"><span>Minute 5</span>
		  <div class="content-block">
			Commit to God the things of the day: meetings/events, people, challenges etc. and thank Him for His grace, strength and peace to do His will in the day ahead.

		<div class="swiper-slide"><span>Minute 6</span>

              </p>
              <p>May you know His joy in your heart from your time with Him to-day.

		<div class="swiper-slide"><span>Persevere</span>
		  <div class="content-block">
			Living from your time with God and His living and active word to you each day, is the most powerful way to live.  It will help you to live life to the full and to fulfill the plans that God made for you from the creation of the universe.  It will become easier to keep and even extend the 8 minutes you have with God each morning.  However, you will need to persevere to establish the good habit of spending time with God and learning to hear His voice.
