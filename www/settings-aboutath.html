        Our heart is to ‘bring good news to the poor, to bind up the brokenhearted, bring freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.’ Currently, we are:</p>
        <p>
        Serving the poor in India – we distributed 35,000 mosquito nets in 2016 and we plan to dig a well in 100 villages in 2017 as well as giving another 15,000 mosquito nets and taking a medical team to do things like immunizations, cataract operations etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are comforting people who are suffering with the comfort that God has given to us to bring:
        </p> 
        <ul>     
       
       <li><span>Healing to the brokenhearted; </span></li>
       <li><span>Hope to the depressed; </span></li>
       <li><span>Help and healing to people suffering from the impact of suicide; </span></li>
       <li><span>Advice and guidance for marriages, especially those in crisis; and </span></li>
       <li><span>Answers for people interested in the afterlife. </span></li>
        </ul> 
         <p>
